## Road/Lane Detection Evaluation 2013

![img](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/images/header_road.jpg)

This benchmark has been created in collaboration with [Jannik Fritsch](mailto:Jannik.Fritsch@honda-ri.de) and Tobias Kuehnl from [Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH](http://www.honda-ri.de/tiki-index.php?page=Welcome). The road and lane estimation benchmark consists of 289 training and 290 test images. It contains three different categories of road scenes:

- uu - urban unmarked (98/100)
- um - urban marked (95/96)
- umm - urban multiple marked lanes (96/94)
- urban - combination of the three above

Ground truth has been generated by manual annotation of the images and is available for two different road terrain types: road - the road area, i.e, the composition of all lanes, and lane - the ego-lane, i.e., the lane the vehicle is currently driving on (only available for category "um"). Ground truth is provided for training images only.
